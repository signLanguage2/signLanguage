## Quick Setup

# npm install  
# npm run start

This project had the goal to predict the signs of ASL, and help people learn the Letters easier. This is done on the client side using Tensorflow Mediapipe.
Only the hand detection was implemented, the model for recognising the letters is in the project (keras_model.h5) but has not been integrated yet. 
This project was written in Romanian.
